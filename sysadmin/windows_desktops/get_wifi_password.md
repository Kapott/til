# Get the wifi password

```batch
netsh wlan show profile {wifi_name} key=clear
```

Corollary: when youre at a hotel that charges for wifi (or for faster wifi), 
get the password from the business center computer which is probably 
connected to the employee wifi.

When at wifi that boots you after 30mins every X hours, windows 10 has a setting 'randomize hardware address' which changes your MAC every time you connect, circumventing this foolery.
