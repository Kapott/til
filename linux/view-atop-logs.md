# View atop logs

Atop is a cool fullscreen monitoring tool which super useful for longterm performance monitoring.

View the logfile for a day
`atop -r /var/log/atop/atop_yyyymmdd`

Then use `?` to show all the keys you can use. The ones you'll probably use most are `t` and `T` to scrub through the timeline of snapshots atop has taken.
