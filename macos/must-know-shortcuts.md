# Must know shortcuts

These shortcuts helped me survive the macbook from day 1, and I still use them every time I have to work with macOS.

`Cmd+Space` opens 'Spotlight' aka a fast way to launch an application.
`Ctrl+click` Equals a right-click.

`Ctrl+Left/Right` Switches between fullscreen applications.  
`Cmd+Tab` Switch between applications.  


`Cmd+w` Close current tab.  
`Cmd+[ or ]` Navigate between tabs.  
`Cmd+click link` Open link in new tab  

`Cmd+q` Close application.  
`Cmd+,` Open settings for current application.
`Cmd+``` Switch between open windows of the application.  


`Cmd+Shift+H` in Finder, the file manager, open the Home folder.  
`Cmd+Shift+D` Finder, open Desktop folder.  
`Cmd+Shift+A` Finder, open Applications folder.  
`Cmd+Shift+U` Finder, open Utilities folder.
