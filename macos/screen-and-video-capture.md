# Screen and video capture

MacOS has built-in screen and video capture functionality. You can access the tool which provides all the options by pressing `Cmd+Shift+5`.

If you want to copy the screenshot so you can paste it somewhere, hold `Ctrl` as well as the following shortcut keys.

The individual shortcuts for screenshots are:

`Cmd+Shift+3`: Screenshot entire screen.
`Cmd+Shift+4`, then click and drag: Screenshot part of the screen.
`Cmd+Shift+4`, then `Spacebar` and select a window or menu bar: Screenshot the application window or menu bar.
`Cmd+Shift+5`: Open the screenshot tool.
`Cmd+Shift+6`: Screenshot the touch bar.

To quit recording your desktop once you're satisfied with the recording, hit `Ctrl+Cmd+Esc`.

By default the screenshots and movies are saved to the Desktop. Movies are saved after you've clicked the recorded Movie in the bottom right.
