# Pivoting users using the setuid bit


## What are we allowed to execute as a superuser?

Start with listing what you're allowed to `sudo`.

```
sudo -l
```

This might give your things which can pop shells themselves, like nano or vi.
In the most basic case it'll allow you to directly run a shellfile with root rights. If you can insert `/bin/bash -i` in there, you're done. 

## Find binaries that have the setuid bit set

List binaries that have `setuid` bit set:

    find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
    find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;

## List of goto binaries which can grant privesc (non-extensive)

Small list of known tools which can grant privesc when setuid isn't set correctly:

- Nmap
- Vim
- find
- Bash
- More
- Less
- Nano
- cp
