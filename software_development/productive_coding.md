# On productive coding

Do not put code in your program that might be used. Do not leave hooks on which you can hang extensions.
The things you might want to do are infinite; that means that each one has 0 probability of realization.
If you need an extension later, you can code it later - and probably do a better job than if you did it now.
And if someone else adds the extension, will they notice the hooks you left?
Will you document that aspect of your program?
