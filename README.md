# Notes

These notes are little gems of knowledge I need to store somewhere, but which I don't think warrant a full blogpost.

# Infosec

Breaking things. That's my definition of fun. Although infosec isn't just about pentesting and redteaming - it's what I love. Blue-team things are mostly stowed under 'sysadmin/network admin' in my mind. So if you're looking for hardening checklists etc. Go check the 'sysadmin' chapter ;)

## Reverse engineering

- [trace everything a file does](infosec/reverse_engineering/trace_everything_a_file_does.md)

# Software development

Creating things. Robustly. Tested. Hopefully. It always struck me as odd that some very abstract and complicated concepts just seem to stick in my mind. But I can never remember what the git flag was for clearing whitespace on commit.

## General advice

- [productive coding](software_development/productive_coding.md)

## Version control

- [git](software_development/git/git.md)

## JVM-based languages

- [Scala build tool](software_development/jvm/sbt.md)

# Sysadmin

Things that have to do with system administration. Setting things up, configuring them and also all blue-team'ish things I need to do once in a while. And as every security pro knows, blue-teaming is just running through checklists, right? ;)

## Administration

- [ACL usage](sysadmin/administration/acl.md)
- [Fast ram disk](sysadmin/administration/fast_ram_disk.md)
- [Processes](sysadmin/administration/process.md)

## Bash

- [Count specific lines in specific files](sysadmin/bash/count_lines.md)
- [Fast command line manipulation](sysadmin/bash/manipulating_commandline.md)
- [History tricks](sysadmin/bash/bash_history.md)
- [Redirecting output of programs](sysadmin/bash/redirecting_output.md)
- [Sorted list of unique words from textfile](sysadmin/bash/sorted_list_of_words_from_textfile.md)

## Databases

- [MongoDB](sysadmin/databases/mongodb.md)

## Linux desktops

- [Creating and using desktop icons](sysadmin/linux_desktops/desktop_icons.md)

# Hardware

Somtimes going back to the nitty gritty of the physical stuff is just a lot of fun. Whipping out chips and transistors and soldering things together might just be what the doctor ordered to get you through the gloomy season that is winter.

## Processors

- [Intel processor designators](hardware/intel_proc_designators.md)
